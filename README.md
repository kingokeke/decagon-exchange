# Decagon Exchange
Decagon Exchange is a project I worked on during the bootcamp phase of the Decagon Institute admission interview process. 
The goal of the project was to simulate a cryptocurrency exchange using the knowledge we had gained from the two-week bootcamp.
On the cryptocurrency exchange simulation, users are able to buy, sell, send and receive cryptocurrency.
